## About KidoX App

Apple removed Launchpad in macOS Tahoe, replacing a familiar visual app launcher with a different app discovery experience.

KidoX is built for people who still want a fast, visual, keyboard-friendly way to browse, organize, and launch Mac apps.

It restores the Launchpad-style grid while improving the parts that matter day to day: quick search, clean organization, smooth navigation, customizable behavior, and a native macOS feel built with SwiftUI.

KidoX is not a system hack or a patched copy of Launchpad. It is an independent macOS app designed to provide a modern launcher experience that feels at home on current versions of macOS.

## Features

Core features:

- Launchpad-style app grid with pages, folders, drag-and-drop arrangement, and keyboard navigation
- Fast in-place search with Chinese names, full pinyin, and pinyin initials
- F4 / Launchpad key support, custom shortcuts, hot corners, menu-bar access, and Dock access
- Optional global four-finger trackpad gesture: pinch to show KidoX, spread to hide it
- Automatic scanning of standard Applications folders
- Wallpaper, glass, and solid-color appearance modes
- Localized app language support

Pro features:

- Advanced sorting modes, including recently used, most used, newly added, and name
- Hidden Apps for keeping rarely used apps out of the launch panel
- Built-in app uninstaller with related app data cleanup and protected-system-app checks
- Custom image backgrounds
- Backup and restore for layout, hidden apps, launch stats, sorting, shortcut, appearance, Dock icon, and custom image

The four-finger gesture is optional and disabled by default. It uses a runtime-loaded private macOS multitouch framework, so official KidoX builds are distributed outside the Mac App Store.

## Overview

This repository contains the KidoX Community Edition macOS app source code. It is published for transparency, security review, education, and community contributions under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.

The license-management backend, production release configuration, signing credentials, notarization credentials, and distribution infrastructure are not included in this repository.

## Community Edition

You may read the source code, study how the app works, audit it, modify it, build it, and redistribute it under the terms of the AGPL-3.0 license.

Official KidoX builds are distributed only through channels controlled by the KidoX maintainers. Third-party builds and forks must comply with the AGPL-3.0 license and may not use the KidoX name, logo, icon, or brand assets in a way that suggests an official release or endorsement.

## What's Included

- `KidoX/` - main macOS app source
- `KidoXApp.xcodeproj/` - Xcode project and shared scheme
- `KidoXIPC/` - shared IPC support code
- `KidoXDockTile/` - Dock tile plug-in
- `Resources/` - app icons and bundled visual assets
- `Packaging/DMG/` - local DMG packaging helper scripts

## Requirements

- macOS
- Xcode
- Xcode command line tools

## Local Development

Open `KidoXApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run the `KidoX` scheme.

You can also build from the command line:

```sh
xcodebuild -project KidoXApp.xcodeproj -scheme KidoX -configuration Debug build
```

The project uses Swift Package Manager dependencies resolved by Xcode.

Search supports Chinese text, English names, full pinyin, and pinyin initials: `x` or `xtsz` finds 系统设置, and `wx` or `weixin` finds 微信. With Default sorting, exact initials rank ahead of longer prefix matches. Language-tagged aliases keep unrelated foreign names out of single-letter searches. Search indexes are built in the background and updated when names change.

Run the focused search and compatibility tests with:

```sh
xcodebuild -project KidoXApp.xcodeproj -scheme KidoXSearch -destination 'platform=macOS' test
```

This test scheme runs without launching KidoX or loading its user database. The tests are also registered in the main `KidoX` scheme.

Local builds are intended for evaluation, review, and development. If you distribute modified builds, you are responsible for complying with AGPL-3.0 and for removing or replacing reserved KidoX brand assets where required.

## Packaging

The DMG helper lives at `Packaging/DMG/build-dmg.sh`.

Release packaging requires local signing, notarization, and production configuration that are intentionally not committed to this repository. Local files such as `Packaging/DMG/release.env` are ignored and should not be committed.
